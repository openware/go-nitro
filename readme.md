Implementation of nitro protocol in golang.

## Roadmap

The following roadmap gives an idea of the various packages that compose the `go-nitro` module, and their implementation status:

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ channel ðŸš§                 # query the latest supported state of a channel
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ state âœ…               # generate and recover signatures on state updates
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ outcome âœ…         # define how funds are dispersed when a channel closes
â”œâ”€â”€ client ðŸš§                  # exposes an API to the consuming application
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ engine ðŸš§              # coordinate the client components, runs the protocols
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ chainservice ðŸš§    # watch the chain and submit transactions
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ messageservice ðŸš§  # send and recieves messages from peers
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ store ðŸš§           # store keys, state updates and other critical data
â”œâ”€â”€ protocols ðŸš§
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ interfaces.go âœ…       # specify the interface of our protocols
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ direct-fund âœ…         # fund a channel on-chain
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ direct-defund ðŸš§       # defund a channel on-chain
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ virtual-fund ðŸš§        # fund a channel off-chain through one or more intermediaries
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ virtual-defund ðŸš§      # defund a channel off-chain through one or more intermediaries
â””â”€â”€ types ðŸš§                   # basic types and utility methods
```


## Usage

Consuming applications should import the `client` package, and construct a `New()` client by passing in a chain service and message service.


## Architecture in Brief

The `engine` listens for action-triggering events from:
- the consuming application / user via the go-nitro `client`
- the `chain` service (watching for on-chain updates to running channels)
- the `message` service (communicating with peers about the status of running or prospective channels)

and executes logic from the `protocols` package. Data required for the secure creation, running, and closing of channels lives in the `store`.

More detailed information can be found in each package's respective _readme_.
